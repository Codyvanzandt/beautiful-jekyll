title: About Me
---

I'm currently a software engineer at [JPMorgan Chase & Co.](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) in Houston, Texas. In addition to building things for JPMorgan's Corporate Investment Bank, I also recruit and mentor new hires, conduct technical interviews, and teach Python programming.

Outside of working hours, I use computational and interpretive methods to probe literary questions such as "What actually *is* a protagonist?", "What exactly makes the plot thicken?", and "Is historical fiction more historical or fictional?" I bucket my questions as narrative theory or (more broadly) critical theory, and my methods as (literary) data mining, computational text analysis, and (again, more broadly) digital humanities. In terms of tools, I'm a [Pythonista](https://www.python.org/) at heart. In terms of texts, I focus on 20th century American literature, but I also have a soft spot for Shakespeare. 

I've taught all sorts of things in all sorts of contexts to all sorts of folks. Those things are usually writing, guitar, or programming, but not always. I believe there are few things more useful than teaching, and so I often find myself teaching far outside my comfort zone in order to meet needs that might otherwise go unmet. That's how I ended up concurrently teaching a game-show-style mental math class and conducting an ad hoc *a cappella* group.

Biographically, I grew up in [Crystal Beach, Texas](https://www.crystalbeachlocalnews.com/) - a tiny coastal town one hour from the Texas-Lousisana border and ten steps from the Gulf of Mexico. I then got my BA in Computer Science and English from [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) where I also taught guitar, produced shows for the notorious [Marching Owl Band](https://www.mob.rice.edu/), and directed a rambunctious theater-in-the-round production of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest.

I'm in the process of migrating my scholarship and other important tidbits to this website. As the site grows, you'll find digital humanities scholarship, programming tips, teaching resources, theater scripts, and musings on Things That I Think Matterâ„¢

My contact information can be found in logo form at the bottom of this page (and most others on the site), although emailing me [here](mailto:cody.a.vanzandt@gmail.com) will likely be fastest. Feel free to reach out - I'll happily respond to any questions or comments.
