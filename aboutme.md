title: About Me
---

I'm currently a software engineer at [JPMorgan Chase & Co.](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) in Houston, Texas. In addition to building things for JPMorgan's Corporate Investment Bank, I also recruit and mentor new engineers, conduct technical interviews, and teach Python programming.

Outside of working hours, I use computational and interpretive methods to probe literary questions such as "How does literary influence work?", "What exactly makes plots thicken?", and "Is historical fiction more historical or fictional?" In terms of quantitative tools, I'm a [Pythonista](https://www.python.org/), and in terms of texts, I focus on 20th century American literature.

I've also taught all sorts of things in all sorts of contexts to all sorts of folks. Those things are usually writing, guitar, or programming, but not always. I love teaching outside of my comfort zone and experimenting with unusual pedagogical approaches. The most peculiar (and successful) recent experiment was an advanced mental math class that I taught at [Lamar University's Texas Governor's School](https://www.lamar.edu/education/partnerships-and-initiatives/texas-governors-school/index.html) as a [Mario Party-esque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Party) competitive/collaborative game show.  

Biographically, I grew up in [Crystal Beach, Texas](https://www.crystalbeachlocalnews.com/) - a tiny coastal town one hour from the Texas-Lousisana border and right on the Gulf of Mexico. I then got my BA in Computer Science and English from [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) where I also [taught guitar](https://courses.rice.edu/courses/!SWKSCAT.cat?p_action=COURSE&p_term=201520&p_crn=24281), produced shows for the notorious [Marching Owl Band](http://mob.rice.edu/), and directed a rambunctious theater-in-the-round production of Oscar Wilde's *The Importance of Being Earnest*.

I'm in the process of migrating my scholarship and other important tidbits to this website. As the site grows, you'll find digital humanities scholarship, programming tips, teaching resources, theater scripts, and musings on Things That I Think Matter.
