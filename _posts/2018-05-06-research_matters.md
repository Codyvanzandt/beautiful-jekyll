Three often overlooked elements of great research...

### Presentation

It's my opinion that, for writing to be great, it must inform, persuade, and entertain all at once. It's also my opinion that, for academic writing to be great, it must do *exactly the same thing.* 

Writing rarely holds readers in thrall by the strength of its ideas alone. Even academic writing needs splashes of style and showmanship to reach and convince the largest possible audience.

Dull prose, no matter how clean it is, robs arguments of persuasive power and imposes unnecessary burdens on readers. It creates a barrier between the words and the argument, and by doing so, reminds readers that they're not engaging directly with ideas, but with text. 

Engaging prose breaks down that barrier. As a result, the sign fades, the signified clarifies, and the reader can engage more fully with the writer's ideas.

In short, a good argument is self-sufficient, but a great argument isn't.

### The Process

Research in the humanities too frequently appears to come straight from the swirling depths of genius and directly unto the page. The evidence is compelling, the logic is air-tight, and the process is nowhere to be found.

Research doesn't move from initial idea to polished argument in clean little mental jumps. It moves with uneven steps - meandering or lurching as often as charging or marching. But all the steps (and particularly the *missteps*) rarely make it to the finished product. And that's a shame. 

If a given process yields compelling findings, then that alone says something about the object under study. And if the findings perhaps aren't all that useful, well hey, *that's* useful in and of itself.

But no useful information ever comes out from a process that no one sees.

### The Negative Result

Imagine a paper titled...

***Is Shakespeare's Nick Bottom a Christ Figure? Uh... Maybe?***

Or another one...

***Can Weather Data Accurately Predict Newspaper Readership? Nope.***

It just doesn't happen. 

Researchers (particularly in the humanities) rarely publish the failed experiment, the inconclusive study, or the argument that just wouldn't solidify. That's a problem, particularly in fields that often adhere to the scientific method. When a researcher hides a null result, they bias the body of literature on a subject towards the positive, throw away hard-won knowledge, and contribute to an academic publishing culture that privileges positive results over negative.

But the gears of change are in motion. Some journals are calling for negative results while others *only* accept negative results.

What positive signs!
