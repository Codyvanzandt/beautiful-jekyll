## 1. A Transparent, Repeatable Process

Research in the humanities too frequently appears to come straight from the swirling depths of genius and directly unto the page. The evidence is compelling, the logic is air-tight, and the process is absent.

Research doesn't move from initial idea to polished argument in clean little mental jumps. It moves with uneven steps - meandering or lurching as often as charging or marching. But all the steps (and particularly the *missteps*) rarely make it to the finished product. And that's a shame. 

In the coming months, I hope to shift my research process completely out into the open. I'll take notes, program, and write my drafts in [Python Notebooks], commit each day's progress to [Github], and serve up the final products in fully interactive Docker containers provided by [Binder]. Everything will be fully visible and completely reproducible: every stumble, success, and improvement. And thanks to [Binder]() (which I'm linking *again* because it's just that amazing), folks will be able to pull down my code and run it right away - no dependencies required!

## 2. Embracing Negative Results

Imagine a paper titled...

***I Thought Nick Bottom Was a Christ Figure.  But I Was Wrong***

Or another one...

***Can Weather Data Accurately Predict Newspaper Readership? Nope.***

It just doesn't happen. 

Researchers (particularly in the humanities) rarely publish the failed experiment, the inconclusive study, or the argument that just wouldn't solidify. That's a problem, particularly in fields (like DH) that often adhere to the scientific method. When a researcher hides a null result, they bias the body of literature on a subject towards the positive, throw away hard-won knowledge, and contribute to an academic publishing culture that privileges positive results over negative.

But the gears of change are in motion. Some journals are [calling for negative results](http://culturalanalytics.org/2018/03/send-us-your-null-results/) while others *only* [accept](http://www.jnr-eeb.org/index.php/jnr/index) [negative](https://jnrbm.biomedcentral.com/) [results](http://revistas.proeditio.com/jonnpr/index).

And while I can't say that I'm rooting for negative results, I can say that I'll be polishing those results for publication with the same care as postive ones.
