# **Final Words, Or What You Will**

If you've made it all the way through **Better Coding Through Shakespeare**, I congratulate you. This series weighs in at a few thousand words and includes a fair bit of code. It's not exactly light reading.

I hope that you've found this series instructive, but I'll also accept that you believe I am...

> A most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise breaker, the owner of no one good quality [16] 

And you know, that's fine by me.

I didn't write this series to proselytize for my particular coding religion. I wrote this because these questions of 
functions, arguments, comments, formatting, and objects are all worth asking. 
It doesn't matter that you've accepted my answers, only that you've considered the questions.

Thanks for reading, and good luck out there.
