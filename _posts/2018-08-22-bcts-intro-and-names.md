# **Better Coding Through Shakespeare**
### **Adapted from Robert C. Martin's *Clean Code* and the works of William Shakespeare**

When you learned to write essays, your instructors didn't just focus on syntax. They recognized that you also needed the answers to some pretty important organizational questions:

- How should I format and organize my essays?
- How big should my essays, paragraphs, and sentences be?
- How can I write well-constructed setences, paragraphs, and essays?
- How can I cleanly connect my sentences and paragraphs together?

Your answers likely have changed since your writing instructors came down from Mount Sinai with the five-paragraph essay. But that original framework still provided you with a solid foundation on which to build your writing skill.

In sharp constrast, I'd wager that when you learned to write code, no one spent much time answering these questions:

- How should I format and organize my code files?
- How big should my files, classes, and functions be?
- How do I write well-constructed functions, classes, and files?
- How can I cleanly connect my functions and classes together?

I think you can see where I'm going with this. 

Good writing - be it an essay or a program - requires good organization, and solid organizational principles actually don't change all that much from prose to code. Accordingly, this seris borrows from *both* a famous software engineer (Robert C. Martin) and a famous writer (William Shakespeare) in order to help you write better code. You're in good hands: Martin is a a thought-leader in software engineering, and Shakespeare - being "not of an age but for all time" - naturally has much programming advice to share.

And so without further ado...
