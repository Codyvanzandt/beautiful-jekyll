During my senior year of college, I decided against excellent advice to found a theater company. I had this vision, you see. This company would be a springboard for amateurs - a place where passionate yet inexperienced college-aged thespians and designers could go and get that necessary "first gig." A place where unproven carpenters, costumers, and cast-members could have real autonomy and do real work. It wouldn't be original, the world already had plenty of amazing theater companies with similar aspirations, but it would be mine.

And so, fully convinced that my almost-complete English degree was preparation enough, I charmed $1000 out of my college's coffers and set to work on the Brown College Theatre Company. It was a gargantuan task that I - caught up in Romantic, bohemian dreams - severely underestimated. But through a combination of great fortune and even greater collaborators, I managed a rambunctious production of Oscar Wilde's *The Importance of Being Earnest.*

The show ran on two consecutive weekends in Rice University's quirky, octagonal Farnsworth Pavilion. The audience sat in three concentric circles - close enough to touch the actors - around an unelevated 16-ft-in-diameter circular "stage." The actors whirled around the tiny space, deconstructing and recombining our modular set at whim and casually tossing lines (and in some cases, props) at audience members. The "fourth wall" lied in ruins. The show ran in three acts, in 90 minutes, and without an intermission. It had two between-act interludes that changed almost nightly and often featured the company's patrons who, clad in theatrical-only-if-you-thought-about-it clothing, rushed the stage from their inconspicuous first-row seats. Two days before our second Friday's performance, my leading actor let slip that he had an identical twin. Naturally, I upended my script and wrote the twin brother into Friday's interlude; it was beautifully bizarre.

Farnsworth, unfortunately, was a public space that we had to vacate completely after every show. Mind you, we had enough modular-wooden-block set-pieces to simultaneously stage a three-person sofa, a lounge chair, two coffee tables, and a dining table with four chairs.  But as we were short on both storage and funds, we had to pack the whole show into my 1999 Chevy Tahoe every single night. It fit. Barely. And in precisely *one* configuration that I, cackling maniacally, would drive back to my dorm until the next show. I loved every minute of it.

Storage woes notwithstanding, the show was a hit. My first-time costumer worked miracles in thread, and my "always the carpenter never the designer" stage-designer crafted a gorgeous modular set made entirely out of movable black and white blocks. My producer-cum-partner excelled in the unenviable job of keeping me out of trouble, and our group of enthusiastic first-time thespians acted their hearts out. *Earnest* was a heartwarming, exhausting, and profoundly enlightening experience for which I will be forever grateful. It was also the Brown College Theatre Company's only production.

Small organizations like these are often held together by sheer force of will on the part of their founders, and my little theater company didn't survive my graduation. College clubs have notoriously small half-lives. Those that require substantial capital and demand hundreds of hours of skilled labor (or in my case, bumbling but determined labor) burn out all the quicker. But I like to think that the company lives on in the stories that its cast and crew might tell of their time strutting around and waxing poetical of Oscar Wilde's deathless dialogue. It's a happy thought.

It's been two years since our closing night. Two years since I promised to write up my experiences in detail. As a first-time director and founder, I learned from a staggeringly large and diverse array of mistakes that I'm vain enough to believe might benefit someone. But that longer reflection is still forthcoming and might easily remain so for another two years. Or longer. Until then, I'll content myself with a short blog post filled with fond memories of my time with *Earnest* and the Brown College Theatre Company.
