During my senior year of college, I decided against excellent advice to found a theater company. I had a vision. The company would be a springboard for amateurs - a place where passionate yet inexperienced college-aged thespians could get that necessary "first gig." A place where unproven carpenters, costumers, and cast-members could have real autonomy and do real work. It wouldn't be original, the world already had plenty of theater companies with similar aspirations, but it would be mine.

And so, fully convinced that my almost-complete English degree was preparation enough, I charmed $1000 out of my college's coffers and set to work on the Brown College Theatre Company. It was a gargantuan task that I severely underestimated. But through a combination of great fortune and even greater collaborators, I managed a rambunctious production of Oscar Wilde's *The Importance of Being Earnest.*

The show ran on two consecutive weekends in Rice University's quirky, octagonal Farnsworth Pavilion. The audience sat in three concentric circles - close enough to touch the actors - around an unelevated 16-ft-in-diameter circular "stage." The actors whirled around the tiny space, deconstructing and recombining our modular set at whim, casually tossing lines (and in some cases, props) at audience members. The "fourth wall" crumbled into ruins. The show ran in three acts, in 90 minutes, and without an intermission. It had two between-act interludes that changed nightly and often featured the company's patrons who, clad in theatrical-only-if-you-thought-about-it clothing, rushed the stage from their inconspicuous first-row seats. Two days before our second Friday's performance, my leading actor let slip that he had an identical twin brother. Naturally, I wrote the brother into Friday's interlude; it was beautifully bizarre.

Farnsworth, unfortunately, was a public space that we had to vacate completely after every show. Mind you, we had enough modular-wooden-block set-pieces to simultaneously stage a three-person sofa, a lounge chair, two coffee tables, and a dining table with four chairs.  But as we were short on both storage and funds, we had to pack the whole show into my 1999 Chevy Tahoe every. single. night. It fit, but in precisely *one* configuration that I would drive back to my dorm, cackling maniacally as heavy set pieces crashed around me.

Storage woes notwithstanding, the show was a hit. My first-time costumer worked miracles in thread, and my "always the carpenter never the designer" stage-designer crafted a gorgeous modular set made entirely out of movable black and white blocks. My producer/partner excelled in the unenviable job of keeping me (and the production) out of trouble, and our group of enthusiastic first-time thespians acted their hearts out. *Earnest* was a heartwarming, exhausting, and profoundly enlightening experience for which I will be forever grateful. It was also the Brown College Theatre Company's only production.

College clubs like these have notoriously short lives. They are often held together by sheer force of will on the part of their founders, and my little theater company didn't survive my graduation. But I like to think that the company lives on in stories recounted by its cast and crew. It's a happy thought.
