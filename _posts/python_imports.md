# Imports

## Imports: An Overview

### What Is an Import?
**Imports** allow us to use code that lives somewhere else -- somewhere different than where we're currently working. 

### What Do You Mean by "Somewhere Else?"

#### Modules
Python code lives in files that end in ".py"
In Python-speak, these Python files are called **"modules"**.
In a perfect world, we divide up our code into Python **modules** much in the same way as we divide up our writing into paragraphs. One paragraph expresses one idea. One module expresses one idea.
