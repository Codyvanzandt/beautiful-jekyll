# Imports

## Imports: An Overview

### What Is an Import?
**Imports** allow us to use code that lives somewhere else -- somewhere different than where we're currently working. 

### What Do You Mean by "Somewhere Else?"

#### Modules
Python code lives in files that end in ".py"
In Python-speak, these Python files are called **"modules"**.
In a perfect world, we divide up our code into Python **modules** much in the same way as we divide up our writing into paragraphs. One paragraph expresses one idea, just as one **module** expresses one idea.

(Kitchen example! Fork.py, Knife.py, Spoon.py, KitchenDrawer.py )

#### Packages
If Python code lives in modules, then where do those 
Now that we've divided our Python code in **modules**, we can go even further and divide our **modules** into **packages**.  To continue with our writing metaphor: if **modules** are paragraphs, then **packages** are chapters.
