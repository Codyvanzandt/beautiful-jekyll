# Imports

## What Is an Import?
**Imports** allow us to use code that lives somewhere else -- somewhere different than where we're currently working. 

## What Do You Mean by "Somewhere Else?"

### Modules
Python code lives in files that end in ".py"
In Python-speak, these Python files are called **"modules"**.
In a perfect world, we divide up our code into Python **modules** much in the same way as we divide up our writing into paragraphs. One paragraph expresses one idea, just as one **module** expresses one idea.

(Kitchen example! Fork.py, Knife.py, Spoon.py, KitchenDrawer.py )

### Packages
If Python code lives in modules, then where do modules live? 
Modules live in folders, or in Python-speak, **packages**.
Just as **modules** allow us to group together pieces of Python code, **packages** allow us to group together related **modules**. Continuing with our writing metaphor, **packages** are chapters that combine paragraphs together in order to express an even bigger idea.
And just like chapters can contain sub-chapters inside of them, packages can contain sub-packages! 

## Back to Imports
Now ththat Python code lives in packages and modules. It's time to get back to our original question: how do we use Python code that lives somewhere else?
