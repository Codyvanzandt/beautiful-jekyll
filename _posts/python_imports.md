## Imports: An Overview

### What Is an Import?
**Imports** allow us to use code that lives somewhere else -- somewhere different than where we're currently working. 

### What Do You Mean by "Somewhere Else?"

#### Modules
Python code lives in files that end in ".py"
In Python-speak, these Python files are called **"modules"**.
In a perfect world, we divide up our code into Python **modules** much in the same way as we divide up our writing into paragraphs. One paragraph expresses one idea, just as one **module** expresses one idea.

(Kitchen example! Fork.py, Knife.py, Spoon.py, KitchenDrawer.py )

#### Packages
If Python code lives in modules, then where do modules live? 
Modules live in folders, or in Python-speak, **packages**.
Just as **modules** allow us to group together pieces of Python code, **packages** allow us to group together related **modules**. Continuing with our writing metaphor, **packages** are chapters that combine paragraphs together in order to express an even bigger idea. 

And just like chapters might contain sub
