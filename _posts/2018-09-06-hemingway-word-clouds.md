What was Hemingway reading while writing *The Sun Also Rises*?

I scraped, cleaned, parsed, and organized the books that he borrowing from the Shakespeare and Company lending library while he was writing *The Sun Also Rises*.
Statistical analysis is forthcoming, but in the meanwhile, here are some fun (and maybe even enlightening) word clouds! 

The clouds are organized by part-of-speech with word-size corresponding to relative frequency. The common nouns are particularly compelling; I think they're 
a better-than-fair approximation of a Hemingway topic model.

If you'd like to download one of these clouds for closer inspection or see how they were generated, you can check out [this
project's Github repository](https://github.com/Codyvanzandt/HemingwayStylometry).
