How often did Ernest Hemingway check out books?

Thanks to [The Center for Digital Humanities @ Princeton](https://cdh.princeton.edu/) and their
[Mapping Expatriate Paris project](https://mep.princeton.edu/), we now have access to 
[high-quality xml markups](https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/mapping-expatriate-paris) of the
Lost Generation's library cards from the [Shakespeare and Company lending library](https://mep.princeton.edu/shakespeare-and-company/).

Below is a visualization from my early exploration into Ernest Hemingway's borrowing patterns.
