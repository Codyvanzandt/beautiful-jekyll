A couple of years ago, I [knew I wanted to direct *The Importance of Being Earnest*](/2019-01-07-earnest-reflection). That was all I knew. I'd never adapted a script, hosted an audition, or planned a rehearsal schedule. Starting from a place of such stupendously small knowledge was difficult (caution: serious understatement), but I learned a *ton* and ended up producing the best-resources-ever-in-all-the-world for directing *Earnest* (caution: serious overstatement, although they *are* pretty good). 

I'm particularly proud of the script. Most full versions run between 180 and 210 minutes; mine runs in 90 minutes without any intermissions, which you don't need for a 90-minute comedy anyway. Obviously, I made deep, *deep* cuts, but the resulting script is lean, coherent, and respectful of the original. I also think that its absurd speed makes the "everyone is just casually accepting this nonsense?!" thing even funnier. Needless to say, I recommend it!

Here is [the script](/downloads/Earnest_Script.pdf)

Here are my [audition sides](/downloads/Earnest Audition Sides.pdf)

And here is my [rehearsal schedule](/downloads/Earnest-Rehearsal-Schedule.ods) with some [necessary information about the scenes](/downloads/Earnest-French-Scene-Groupings.ods)
