A couple of years ago, I knew I wanted to direct *The Importance of Being Earnest*. That was all I knew. 

I'd never adapted a script, hosted an audition, or planned a rehearsal schedule. Starting from a place of such stupendously small knowledge was difficult (caution: serious understatement), but I learned a *ton* and ended up producing some solid resources for directing *Earnest*.

I'm particularly proud of the script. Many full versions approach 180 minutes; mine runs in 90 minutes without any intermissions, which you don't need for a 90-minute comedy anyway. Obviously, I made deep, *deep* cuts, but the resulting script is both coherent and respectful of the original. I also think that its speed makes *Earnest's* straight-faced absurdity even funnier. Needless to say, I think it's a great adaptation.

Here is [the script](/downloads/Earnest_Script.pdf)

Here are my [audition sides](/downloads/Earnest Audition Sides.pdf)

And here is my [rehearsal schedule](/downloads/Earnest-Rehearsal-Schedule.ods) with some [necessary information about the scenes](/downloads/Earnest-French-Scene-Groupings.ods)
