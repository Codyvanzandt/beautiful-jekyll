# About
I'm currently a PhD student in English and American Literature at Washington University in St. Louis. Previously, I was a software engineer for JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Houston, Texas. 

My scholarship focuses on computational approaches to literary study, particularly stylometry and network analysis of dramatic texts.

I teach writing and literature, but I'm amusingly easy to sell on unusual teaching experiences. My more exotic teaching credits include: competitive mental math for primary schoolers, *a cappella* for secondary schoolers, guitar for undergraduates, and software engineering for financial analysts. 

Relatedly, I enjoy acting and playing stringed instruments. I even do those things publicly whenever someone is ~~foolish~~ kind enough to let me.
