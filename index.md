# About
I'm a PhD student in English and American Literature at Washington University in St. Louis where I use computational methods to study genre, plot, and style.
Accordingly, my biggest disciplinary commitments are to machine learning, network analysis, narrative theory, and formalisms both old and new.

I teach writing and literature, of course, but I'm amusingly easy to sell on more unusual teaching experiences.
My pedagogical Greatest Hits include competitive mental math for elementary schoolers, commedia dell'arte for middle schoolers, *a cappella* for high schoolers, guitar for undergraduates, and software engineering for financial analysts. 

I enjoy acting and playing stringed instruments, and I even do those things publicly whenever someone is ~~foolish~~ kind enough to let me.

I bluster on Twitter [@CodyVanZandt](https://twitter.com/CodyVanZandt), sling code on GitHub [@Codyvanzandt](https://github.com/Codyvanzandt), exist (at least nominally) on LinkedIn [@codyvanzandt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/codyvanzandt), and respond to email at <a href="cody.a.vanzandt@gmail.com">cody.a.vanzandt@gmail.com</a>.

If you'd like to chat, feel free to send an email or a Twitter DM.
