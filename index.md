# About
In the fall of 2019, I will be a PhD student in English at Washington University in St. Louis. Previously, I was a software engineer for JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Houston, Texas. 

I work on modernist literature, digital humanities, theater in performance, and the sociology of literature. Quantitative methods are essential to my work, both as tools and as objects of study in their own right. I'm particularly committed to the idea that quantitative evidence and close reading can work together productively and robustly, even at relatively small scales.

I predominately teach writing, literature, and guitar, but I'm amusingly easy to sell on unusual teaching experiences. My more exotic teaching credits include: competitive mental math for primary schoolers, *a cappella* for secondary schoolers, and software engineering for career-switching financial analysts. 

Semi-relatedly, I enjoy acting and playing stringed instruments. I even do those things publicly whenever someone is bold enough to let me.
