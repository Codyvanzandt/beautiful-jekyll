# About
I'm currently a first-year PhD student in English and American Literature at Washington University in St. Louis. Previously, I was a software engineer for JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Houston, Texas. 

My scholarship focuses on computational approaches to literary study. I'm particularly committed to the idea that quantitative methods and close reading can work together productively and robustly at scales far smaller than the distant reader's massive corpus.

I teach writing and literature, but I'm amusingly easy to sell on unusual teaching experiences. My more exotic teaching credits include: competitive mental math for primary schoolers, *a cappella* for secondary schoolers, guitar for undergraduates, and software engineering for financial analysts. 

Semi-relatedly, I enjoy acting and playing stringed instruments. I even do those things publicly whenever someone is bold enough to let me.

You can contact me [via email](mailto:codyvanzandt@wustl.edu).
