	<h3 class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">Because it's complicated!</h3>

	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Dramatic</h3>
		<div class="fragment fade-in">
		<blockquote>
		<p>'49 Wyatt, 01549 Wyatt.</p>
		<p>Coming sergeant.</p>
		<p>Pick 'em up, pick 'em up—I'll stalk within yer chamber.</p>
		</blockquote>
		</div>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Epic</h3>
		<div class="fragment fade-in">
		<blockquote>
		<p>Temporary unpaid Lance-Corporal Aneirin Merddyn Lewis had somewhere in his Welsh depths a remembrance of the nature of man...</p>
		</blockquote>
		</div>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Lyric</h3>
		<div class="fragment fade-in">
		<blockquote>
		<p>You step down between inward inclining, heavily bulged, walls of earth; you feel the lateral slats firm foothold.</p>
		</blockquote>
		</div>

<section>
	<h3>Narrative Speed</h3>
	<section>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Moment</h3>
		<div class="fragment fade-in">
		<blockquote>
		<p>Bodies move just at head level, outside the trench; hollow unreal voices, reaching the ear unexpectedly, from behind or round the traverse bend, like the shouting at the immediate door comes on you from a far window...</p>
		</blockquote>
		</div>

	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Scene</h3>
<div class="fragment fade-in">
		<blockquote>
		<p>She said that it was a pleasant morning, and the first in June.</p>
		<p>He said it was time the English advanced, that they were a stupid race, anyhow.</p>
		<p>She said they were not.</p>
		</blockquote>
		</div>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Summary</h3>
<div class="fragment fade-in">
		<blockquote>
		<p>They talked of ordinary things. Of each one's friends at home; those friends unknown to either of the other two. Of the possible duration of the war. Of how they would meet and in what good places afterwards.</p>
		</blockquote>
		</div>

<h2>The Epic Moment</h2>
<div class="fragment fade-in">
		<blockquote>
		<p>And to Private Ball it came as if a rigid beam of great weight flailed about his calves, caught from behind by ballista-baulk let fly or aft-beam slewed to clout gunnel-walker below below below.</p>
		</blockquote>
		</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Lyric Summary</h2>
<div class="fragment fade-in">
		<blockquote>
		<p>Now you looked about you for what next to do, or you fired blindly among the trees and ventured a little further inward; but already, diagonally to your front, they were coming back in ones and twos.</p>
		</blockquote>
		</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Epic-Moment-Lyric-Summary?</h2>
<div class="fragment fade-in">
		<blockquote style="width:100%">
		<p>And the next one to you, where he bends to delve gets it in the middle body. Private Ball is not instructed, and how could you stay so fast a tide, it would be difficult with him screaming whenever you move him ever so little, let alone try with jack-knife to cut clear the hampering cloth.
The First Field Dressing is futile as frantic seaman's shift bunged to stoved bulwark, so soon the darking flood percolates and he dies in your arms.</p>
